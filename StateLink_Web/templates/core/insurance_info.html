                    <p class="lead">If you're running a business in North Carolina, you're not just managing operations—you're also navigating a web of legal responsibilities that can carry serious consequences if ignored. Whether you're a contractor in Raleigh, a retailer in Charlotte, or a startup in Asheville, business insurance is not just smart—it's often required by North Carolina law.</p>

                            <h3 class="h5 text-primary">Workers' Compensation is Legally Required</h3>
                            <p class="mb-0">In North Carolina, if you have three or more employees, you're legally obligated to carry workers' compensation insurance—even if they're part-time or seasonal. Noncompliance can result in civil penalties, criminal charges, and business shutdowns.</p>

                            <h3 class="h5 text-primary">Liability Lawsuits Are Costly and Common</h3>
                            <p class="mb-0">One accident or claim—like a slip-and-fall, property damage, or a dissatisfied client—can trigger a lawsuit. General liability insurance helps cover legal defense, settlements, and court-ordered judgments. Without it, your personal assets could be on the line.</p>
